### ðŸ“˜ Credit Card Fraud Detection

#### ðŸ§¾ Project Overview  
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a real, anonymized dataset. Due to severe class imbalance, SMOTE was used for oversampling the minority class.

---

#### ðŸŽ¯ Task Objectives  
- Build a binary classifier to detect fraud.  
- Address class imbalance with SMOTE.  
- Evaluate models using AUC, precision, and recall.

---

#### ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps  
- Verified dataset shape: 284,807 records with 30+ features.  
- Applied `StandardScaler` to `Amount`.  
- Dropped `Time` and original `Amount` features.  
- Split data and applied **SMOTE** on training set to balance classes.

---

#### ðŸ¤– Model Selection  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model was evaluated on a held-out test set using ROC AUC and classification metrics.

---

#### ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis  
- **Random Forest Classifier**:  
  - ROC AUC Score: 0.9737  
  - Precision & Recall significantly improved over baseline  
- Plotted **ROC curves** for both models
