### ðŸ“˜ Iris Flower Classification

#### ðŸ§¾ Project Overview  
This project classifies iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It is a classic supervised classification task using the well-known Iris dataset.

---

#### ðŸŽ¯ Task Objectives  
- Classify iris flowers as *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*.  
- Visualize class distributions and feature relationships.  
- Train and evaluate a classification model.

---

#### ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps  
- Verified **no missing values**.  
- Encoded the `species` column using `LabelEncoder`.  
- Standardized numerical features with `StandardScaler`.  
- Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

---

#### ðŸ¤– Model Selection  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Model was evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

---

#### ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis  
- **Accuracy**: 100%  
- Achieved perfect classification on the test set, demonstrating model suitability for this well-balanced dataset.
